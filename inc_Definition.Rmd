## Definition

In probability theory, the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** states that,
given certain conditions, the arithmetic mean of a sufficiently large
number of iterates of independent random variables, each with a
well-defined expected value and well-defined variance, will be approximately
normally distributed, regardless of the underlying distribution.

That is, suppose that a sample is obtained containing a large number of
observations, each observation being randomly generated in a way that does
not depend on the values of the other observations, and that the arithmetic
average of the observed values is computed. If this procedure is performed
many times, the central limit theorem says that the computed values of the
average will be distributed according to the normal distribution (commonly known as a "bell curve").
